> Hello friends.  
Markdown on _everything_.

This directory contains the source code for the presentations, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

They will automatically be built and published [here](https://featherbear.cc/unsw-comp3601-project/presentations) when pushed to this GitHub repository

Here's a quick TL;DR on how to create a presentation.

# I'm a terminal warrior, ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ _SHOW ME THE COMMANDS_ âš¡âš¡âš¡

1. Navigate to this directory (should contain `config.toml`, `content/`, ...)  
2. Create a new post with `hugo new [PRESENTATION_NAME].md`  

> The created post will appear in `content/[PRESENTATION_NAME].md`, and will be created as a **draft** (Won't be published).

You can now run `hugo server -DEF` to start a preview server.  
_Note: The `-DEF` flags allows draft presentations to be visible, otherwise they won't appear._

3. Edit the file with markdown. Use `---` as slide separators.  
4. When the post is finalised, remove the `draft: true` property from the front matter

# copy-paste-find-replace

1. Create a copy of any of the existing presentations
2. Change the title and date
3. Edit the content
3. ???
4. Profit
