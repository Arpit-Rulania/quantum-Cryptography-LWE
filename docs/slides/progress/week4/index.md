## Schedule

![](gantt/gantt_change.gif)

Didn't get up to testing the RNG and Multiplier units.  
Testing extended to Week 4

{{% note %}} Fleshed out the specifications for the components {{% /note %}}

{{% note %}} In that process, we also identified a few possible issues and overheads that would make the logic area large {{% /note %}}

## How Big?

{{% section %}} 

As per the project spec, the design needs to validate the provided configurations.

> Does the design stay the same for all three configurations?

Our current design only supports up to 8-bit values.  

> We need to support $q = 65535$  
which is a 16-bit value.

Public key A gets quite big...

We probably don't want to transmit $32768 \times 16 \times 16 \times 16$ bits at once...  

Instead, transmit $16 \times 16 \times 16$ bits $32768$ times?

## Modulo

{{% section %}}

It works... but it's kinda slow...

Save some cycles!

9 cycles? How about 8!

## Multiplier

<div class='side-by-side'>

<part>

> Before

![](./multiplier/multiplier_simple.jpg)

$87 \times 250$ in $87$ cycles

</part>

<part>

> After

![](./multiplier/multiplier_bitwise.jpg)

$87 \times 250$ in $7$ cycles

</part>

</div>
