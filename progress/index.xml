Schedule Didn&amp;rsquo;t get up to testing the RNG and Multiplier units.
Testing extended to Week 4
VHDL Components BEFORE
Fleshed out the specifications for the components AFTER
In that process, we also identified a few possible issues and overheads that would make the logic area large Connection Diagram How Big?</description></item><item><title>Progress - Week 2</title><link>/progress/week2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 19:13:50 +1100</pubDate><guid>/progress/week2/</guid><description>Team Orange Andrew Nicholson Andrew Wong Arpit Rulania Ziyue Lian Week 2 Progress Update
