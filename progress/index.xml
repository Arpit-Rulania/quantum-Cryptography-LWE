Schedule Didn&amp;rsquo;t get up to testing the RNG and Multiplier units.
Testing extended to Week 4
VHDL Components BEFORE
Fleshed out the specifications for the components AFTER
In that process, we also identified a few possible issues and overheads that would make the logic area large Connection Diagram How Big?</description></item><item><title>Progress - Week 5</title><link>/progress/week5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 22:49:43 +1100</pubDate><guid>/progress/week5/</guid><description>Team Orange Andrew Nicholson Andrew Wong Arpit Rulania Ziyue Lian Week 5 Progress Update
Schedule Encryption not yet completed&amp;hellip; but decryption works!
Decryption Module Current bottleneck is the multiplication.
Perhaps pipeline the multiplication?
